## Personal Assistant Discord Bot

A bot that performs a wide range of functions for the user. Built with Python, Flask, and Discord Developers API. Hosted on Replit and monitored by UpTimeRobot.

Inspiration for the project: Wished I had a butler to help me with daily tasks but then I remembered I'm still a broke college student ðŸ˜…. So I decided to compromise and build my own bot(ler).

Current functionalities:

* Quick Reminders 
* Daily Reminders
* Task Keeping
* Weather Notifications

## Project Status
Project currently in development (adding new commands and features)
